# SpeakRight Desktop

SpeakRight Desktop is a Tauri desktop pronunciation-training app for Chinese
learners. American English (`en-US`) is the stable baseline. Spanish (`es-ES`),
French (`fr-FR`), and Russian (`ru-RU`) are experimental modules. Japanese is
not included in this release track.

## Current Product Boundary

- Desktop-only release track. Do not mix this repository with older browser-app workspaces.
- The installed app loads the static Tauri bundle, not a localhost dev server.
- This repository is public source code. `package.json` remains `private: true`
  to prevent accidental npm publication; releases are desktop artifacts, not an
  npm package.
- Public review, source builds, and controlled Release EXE trials are supported.
  A signed public Windows release is not complete yet; unsigned EXE/MSI/NSIS
  artifacts must remain labeled as internal-test or controlled-test builds.
- API keys are stored through the desktop secure/local credential layer where
  supported; they are never committed and are excluded from learning-data
  exports.
- Spanish, French, and Russian word/phrase audio is bundled under
  `public/audio/language-packs/`; users do not install these packs separately.
  Each bundled item now has `blue` and `pink` voice variants, matching the
  English local-audio model.
- Local articulation assets live under `public/videos/language-assets/`.

## Public Download Status

There is not yet a signed public Windows download. GitHub Release assets,
workflow-dispatch artifacts, EXE/MSI/NSIS files, and local Release EXE builds
are controlled-test artifacts unless a release note explicitly says the artifact
is signed and public.

New users who are not part of a controlled-test pass should build from source or
wait for a signed Windows release. Do not bypass SmartScreen, antivirus, or
enterprise policy on a managed device only to try an unsigned artifact; report
the blocker through the installation/startup issue template instead.

Maintainers should keep Release EXE validation as the acceptance path, but they
must not describe an unsigned artifact as a stable public download.

## Development

```bat
cd /d E:\SpeakRightDesktopRepo
npm run desktop:dev
```

The dev build uses the Tauri `devUrl` configured in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
Release builds must use the static export in `out/`.

For manual QA and user testing, launch the Release EXE instead of dev mode:

```bat
cd /d E:\SpeakRightDesktopRepo
npm run desktop:preflight
npm run desktop:launch-release
```

If the Release EXE is missing or stale:

```bat
npm run desktop:run-release
```

`desktop:preflight` and `desktop:launch-release` also refuse to validate or
open a Release EXE when the static export in `out/` is newer than the packaged
executable. After running `npm run build:desktop-frontend` or changing UI code,
run `npm run desktop:build` before Release EXE smoke or manual QA.

For the daily desktop startup checklist, see
`docs/operations/DESKTOP_STARTUP_RUNBOOK.md`.

For Windows installer use, source builds, and first-launch expectations, see
`docs/INSTALLATION.md`.

For the next Codex chat or manual-testing pass, start with
`docs/operations/NEXT_CHAT_HANDOFF.md` and the runbook's `Start Next Chat`
checklist. The first pass should use the Release EXE and cover Settings,
English, Spanish, French, Russian, drill, free practice, and diagnosis before
adding new work.

`docs/operations/RC_EVIDENCE_AUDIT.md`.

## Validation

```bat
npm run test
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build:desktop-frontend
npm run desktop:build
npm run desktop:preflight
npm run desktop:ui-smoke
npm run desktop:live-validation
npm run audio:parity:dry-run
npm run audio:loudness:dry-run
npm run ipa:audit:export
npm run validate:internal-release
```

Use `npm run desktop:build` when you need fresh Windows artifacts. The build
wrapper defaults `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1` on Windows to reduce Rust/LLVM memory
spikes; set `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` yourself before running the command if your
machine or CI runner can safely use more parallelism. Use
`npm run validate:public-release` only after Windows code signing is configured.

The live validation command checks bundled audio/video assets and a high-coverage
Azure pronunciation-assessment sample. It queries ElevenLabs usage only; it does
not generate new audio unless an explicit smoke flag is set outside the normal
release checklist.

`audio:parity:dry-run` checks the Spanish, French, and Russian learning-density
and dual-voice audio contract without calling ElevenLabs. It writes
`src-tauri/target/audio-parity/gap-report.json` and verifies that every required
language-pack item has both `blue` and `pink` local files.

`audio:loudness:dry-run` uses local ffmpeg analysis to compare representative
word A/B audio and IPA chart normal/slow word audio against teaching-video
loudness after playback-layer gain. It writes
`src-tauri/target/audio-loudness/report.json` and makes zero ElevenLabs calls.

`ipa:audit:export` regenerates the tracked Spanish/French/Russian IPA audit
input under `docs/operations/non-english-ipa-audit-input.json`, including
`auditRole` markers that separate full IPA rows from deck focus hints.

`desktop:preflight` checks the active workspace, release executable, static
export freshness, and running `speakright.exe` process before release-style
testing. It never closes the app for you; close SpeakRight manually before
building. `desktop:launch-release` also refuses stale static-export packages and
duplicate `speakright.exe` processes, reports the running process IDs, and prints
a visible launch request, Release EXE path, child PID, and no-localhost boundary
before it detaches the app process. `desktop:ui-smoke` launches the Release EXE,
opens Settings, English, Spanish, French, Russian, drill, free practice, and
diagnosis routes, and confirms the runtime is not served from `localhost`.

GitHub Actions are split by change type: source, public asset, script,
`src-tauri`, or package changes still run the full Windows desktop build, while
README/docs-only changes run the lightweight Docs Check workflow.

## Release Notes

- The current Windows artifacts are for controlled testing unless code signing
  is complete.
- Controlled-test verification records for the current main tree live in
  `docs/operations/RC_EVIDENCE_AUDIT.md`, including the verification date,
  command outputs, Release EXE smoke/launch outcome, and known blockers.
- The current release-hardening proof matrix, exact command results, and known
  blockers live in `docs/operations/RC_EVIDENCE_AUDIT.md`; do not treat an
  older commit SHA or a downloaded installer timestamp as the latest validated
  RC state without checking that audit.
- Bundled audio/video and multilingual parity counts are validated in
  `docs/operations/RC_EVIDENCE_AUDIT.md`; keep that audit as the source of truth
  instead of copying exact asset totals into public overview text.
- Multilingual audio-density expansion target: 24 practice items per Spanish,
  French, and Russian sound unit, with zero-generation parity checks for current
  local coverage.
- Secondary voices selected for the experimental language packs: Spanish
  `Lydia`, French `Rachel`, Russian `Sergey`; the original primary voices
  remain Spanish `Marco Cruz`, French `Clément`, Russian `Valeria`.
- Latest settled-main validation results are centralized in
  `docs/operations/RC_EVIDENCE_AUDIT.md`. The current RC gate covers full tests,
  typecheck, lint, static desktop frontend build, Release EXE preflight,
  Release EXE UI smoke, and Release EXE launch from the static Tauri bundle.
  `desktop:launch-release` now also refuses duplicate running `speakright.exe`
  processes before opening a new Release EXE.
- Verified Azure live sample: `220/220` pronunciation-assessment calls passed.
- ElevenLabs usage during normal validation remains `0` generated characters.
  The one-time multilingual secondary-voice generation was approved separately
  and estimated at about `10645` characters.
- Public release gate still fails only because EXE/MSI/NSIS artifacts are
  unsigned.
- Non-English pronunciation scoring remains experimental; `evidenceMastery`
  stays disabled for `es-ES`, `fr-FR`, and `ru-RU` until provider probes and
  language-specific evidence gates are finished.
- Recent local RC handoff updates tightened non-English practice-card
  readability, one-shot sound-unit speakers across detail and list cards,
  exact scoring-breakdown sound-unit audio,
  local A/B word-audio gain, and formal mastery/progress-archive gating. Long
  words, phrases, sentences, and IPA are shown in full; rule units use Chinese
  labels; speaker buttons are hidden when no local target audio exists, and the
  header speaker component now refuses external-only or browser-TTS fallback
  audio. This pass is documented in `docs/operations/NEXT_CHAT_HANDOFF.md`.
- The current RC evidence audit is tracked in
  `docs/operations/RC_EVIDENCE_AUDIT.md`. It records the proof matrix for
  Release EXE testing, experimental-language boundaries, non-English audio and
  video honesty, centered/wrapping target text, and the English-only formal
  mastery policy.
- The latest Release EXE smoke enforces centered reading targets in addition to
  no ellipsis/nowrap, no practice-button overlap, honest clickable header audio,
  wrapping
  video selector labels plus selector no-overlap/no-overflow runtime checks,
  Settings/usage long-text wrapping, Settings pronunciation-test row
  wrapping/no-overlap runtime checks, A/B voice selector and word-audio button
  visibility/clickability/label runtime checks, scoring-breakdown
  visibility/readability/no-overflow runtime checks plus scoring-tile
  short-audio policy checks, the non-English progress-archive blocker, including
  narrow-window and low-height detail passes, and
  `releaseServedFromDevServer=false`.
- Non-English diagnosis now treats omission/insertion miscues as insufficient
  evidence for a trusted overall score while preserving practice feedback.
- AI coach prompts now treat Spanish, French, and Russian full-score recordings
  conservatively: they can say no obvious issue was found in this recording, but
  they must not call the result perfect or mastered.
- Local bundled word and language-pack A/B audio now uses peak-safe Web Audio
  gain for playback-level loudness matching; very quiet local word clips can use
  up to `12x` peak-safe gain when decoded peaks permit it. IPA chart normal/slow
  word audio now gets a shared playback-layer boost as well. Free-practice
  read-along playback keeps the same boost when it serves a bundled
  language-pack clip, including replay. Online fallback audio is unchanged and
  no ElevenLabs generation is part of this validation path.
- The shared audio-player hook now refuses video-backed sources, so a missed
  upstream guard cannot make a speaker button play a teaching-video track.
- Scoring-breakdown phoneme tiles now reuse the exact same left/detail
  sound-unit header clip (`phonemeAudio.localSrc`) when a verified single-IPA
  alias exists. Unverified, proxy, rule, prosody, or composite segments stay
  visible but unclickable; they no longer fall back to word examples, rule
  audio, proxy media, or teaching-video audio. English chart clicks are capped
  at `560ms`, and local non-English header/scoring clips are capped at `500ms`
  through the shared header playback policy.
- Recording replay and benchmark playback now use the shared audio-player hook,
  so repeated replay clicks stop the previous blob and cleanup stays centralized.
- Direct advanced pack-runner routes and direct progress-archive access now show
  experimental-language blockers instead of loading English training packs or
  formal English mastery archives for Spanish, French, or Russian. HVPT
  perception and formal mastery writes remain gated by the English-only formal
  mastery policy, so Spanish, French, and Russian stay practice/feedback-only
  experimental modules.
